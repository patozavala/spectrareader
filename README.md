# SpectraReader

SpectraReader allows handling the spectral information from objects for real-world applications. Spectroradiometers take the spectral data from things. This data is used to calculate the spectral signature of these objects. Additionally, SpectraReader has several labeled datasets designed for industrials ai-based applications.SpectraReader is a repository that provides AI-based algorithms that use spectral information from objects for real-world applications.

## Main functionalities

* You can import spectral data from multiple spectroscopy instruments.
* You can handle spectral datasets by using pandas.
